1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
    React is a commonly used, and very efficient, UI library which uses condensed pieces of UI called components to build elaborate applications. React utilizes the virtual DOM to update changes within our code. What makes React very useful is the way it utilizes JavaScript which is a familiar and much used language instead of relying heavily on its own API. This allows for one to gain much more in depth knowledge about the JavaScript programming simultaneously.
1. What does it mean to think in react?
    Thinking in React means keeping in mind the functionality, for lack of a better term, of React while building an application. There are several steps to the methodology according to React's website. The steps include: mocking up the project, breaking the UI into a component hierarchy, building a static version in React, identifying the minimal (but complete) representation of UI state, identify where your state should live, and  inverse data flow. 
  
1. Describe state.
    State is at the heart of every React component, it is an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. In other words, State is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive.
  
1. Describe props.
    Props which is short for properties, pass custom data to a React component and also triggers state changes.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
    A side effect is anything that makes an affect outside of the scope of the function being executed. An example of this would be an axios call which has your code communicating with a third party. [part two of this question: I do not understand what you are asking]
